            One SEO component called off-site SEO ensures that users of external
            pages or of social media can find your website. Being optimized for
            SEO increases the site’s potential to draw customers from other
            platforms other than the search engine. For instance, when you post
            content and links to your page on Facebook or Twitter, you are able
            to promote your website and attract more customers. One of the main
