                  on the development of website. For example, Magento is more
                  powerful but OpenCart is much easier to set up and built on an
                  MVC framework. However, OpenCart is flexible, affordable and
                  fast solutions who want to set up their business online in a
                  quick way and at a reasonable cost.
