              <h2>What we do</h2>
              <p>
                Influencer marketing is a marketing strategy that uses
                individuals with a significant social media following to promote
                a brand or product. These individuals, known as influencers, are
                typically experts or celebrities in their respective niches or
                industries and have a loyal and engaged audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Influencer marketing is based on the idea that people are more
                likely to trust and follow the opinions and recommendations of
                people they admire and respect. As a result, companies partner
                with influencers to promote their products or services to their
                followers, who are likely to be interested in those offerings.
