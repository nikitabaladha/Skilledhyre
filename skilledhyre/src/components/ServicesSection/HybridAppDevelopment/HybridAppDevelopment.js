                <p>
                  These applications are designed to run on multiple platforms
                  at once. So they don’t have the same limitations as apps built
                  specifically for one platform. This makes them ideal for
                  businesses that want their presence to reach all their
                  potential customers.

                <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p>
                  A hybrid application can reuse components and design elements
                  across platforms, which helps create a more consistent user
                  experience. This can improve the brand image of an app because
                  users will be exposed to the same look and feel no matter what
                  platform they use it on.
